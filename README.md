Escazo Approach


UI Design Guide for Escazo’s All-in-One Travel Platform
Objective:
Create a seamless, user-friendly platform where users can book flights, hotels, car rentals, short stays, Escazo rideshare, order coffee, and plan trips using an AI budget travel bot—all in one place.
1. Home Page Design
Main Features:
•Unified Search Bar: At the very top of the page, there should be a single search bar where users can input their destination and search for flights, hotels, short stays, and car rentals in one go.
•Placeholder Text: “Search Flights, Hotels, Short Stays, and Car Rentals”
•AI Budget Travel Planning 
Bot:
•Below the search bar, add a button for the AI bot that helps users plan trips based on their budget.
•Bot Button Text: “Plan Your Trip with Our AI Travel Bot”
•Function: When clicked, the bot should ask for details like trip preferences (dates, budget, etc.) and recommend options.

2. Search Results Page Design
Main Features:
•Display All Results on One Page: Once the user searches, display a list of Flights, Hotels, Car Rentals, and Short Stays on the same screen.
•Each category should have its own section but remain on one unified page.
•Use clear, visible filters for price, dates, and type of accommodation.
•Add to Cart Option:
•Beside each search result, add an “Add to Cart” button so the user can select multiple services (e.g., flight + hotel) and pay for everything together later.
3. Rideshare Integration
Main Features:
•Prompt After Booking: After the user selects a flight or hotel, offer them the option to book a rideshare for airport pickups, hotel drop-offs, or general transportation.
•Include a form for the number of passengers so drivers know how many people they’re picking up, and adjust the fare based on that.
•Rideshare Booking Button Text: “Add Rideshare to Your Trip”
4. Escazo Café & Coffee Products
Main Features:
•Coffee Pre-Order Option: On the checkout page, allow users to pre-order coffee to pick up at an Escazo Café during their trip.
•Show a small, simple menu with a few coffee options (e.g., espresso, latte, cold brew).
•Button Text: “Pre-order Coffee for Your Trip”
•Coffee E-Commerce: Include a link to the coffee store where users can buy Escazo coffee products (beans, accessories) that can be shipped to their home.
5. Unified Checkout Page
Main Features:
•Single Payment for All Services: Ensure that all the services (flights, hotels, car rentals, short stays, rideshare, and coffee) are combined into one checkout process.
	
•Show a summary of everything the user has booked, with a total price at the bottom.
	
•Provide clear payment options like credit card, PayPal, or other payment gateways.
6. Mobile-Friendly Design

1.Flight, Hotel, and Car Rental Bookings: By integrating APIs from Travelpayouts, Booking.com, Amadeus, Travelfusion, and Skyscanner, you can offer users a seamless booking experience across different travel needs.
2.Escazo Rideshare Platform: You can build your own rideshare system, allowing travelers to book transportation directly through Escazo. This can be a significant differentiator, providing a unified experience for travelers who don’t need to switch apps for local transport.
3.Coffee Café: Incorporating an e-commerce store or café into the platform will allow travelers to order coffee products or find nearby cafés powered by Escazo, boosting revenue and enhancing the user experience.
4.Short-Stay Platform: You can integrate short-stay accommodations (like Airbnb) directly into Escazo, either through an API or by managing your own listing of vacation homes.
How to Make Escazo Better Than Competitors:
1.Unified Platform Experience:
•By integrating multiple APIs for flights, hotels, and rideshares, Escazo can provide a completely unified experience where travelers don’t need to jump between different platforms or apps.
•Offer a seamless booking flow where users can book a flight, hotel, rideshare, and coffee all in one session.
2.Exclusive Rideshare Features:
•Offer a rideshare service specifically for travelers: Give them control over reporting how many people are traveling, charge accordingly, and ensure the driver is aware of the number of passengers to improve service.
•Integrate rideshare with Escazo’s booking system, so when someone books a flight or hotel, they can also book a ride to/from the airport or hotel at the same time.
3.Specialized Travel Experiences:
•Use APIs like Amadeus and Travelfusion to provide not only standard bookings but also more customized travel experiences—like adventure tours, cruise packages, and more.
•Integrate an option for users to book experiences (tours, excursions, cultural events) along with their travel, making Escazo a one-stop shop.
4.Coffee Café & Product Tie-in:
	
•Offer a loyalty program where travelers can earn points for bookings, which they can redeem for coffee at Escazo’s cafés or online store.
	
•Allow travelers to pre-order coffee at the café of their destination or have coffee products delivered to them during their trip.
	
5.Exclusive Short-Stay Platform:
	
•Develop a system to manage your own vacation homes under the Escazo brand or allow third-party hosts to list their short stays on Escazo. This can give you more control over the types of properties and services offered to your travelers.
	
•Integrate Escazo’s short-stay booking system with other travel services to provide complete trip packages (e.g., home + flight + car rental + rideshare).
	
6.Advanced Personalization and AI:
	
•Use AI and machine learning to provide personalized travel recommendations, suggest hotels or homes based on previous searches, and show the best travel deals.
	
•Incorporate intelligent notifications: for example, if a flight is delayed, Escazo could notify the user and offer them discounted hotel stays or car rentals as compensation.

AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage can be used for storing images, videos, and other media.
Example for uploading files to AWS S3:
javascript
CopyEdit
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3({
  accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
  secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  region: 'us-east-1', // or your region
});

const uploadFile = (file) => {
  const params = {
    Bucket: process.env.S3_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: file.filename,
    Body: file.data,
  };

  return s3.upload(params).promise();
};

7. Deployment Requirements
Database Backups: Set up automated backups for PostgreSQL (or MySQL) and MongoDB.
Load Balancing: Use load balancing services like AWS ELB or GCP Load Balancer to ensure availability and distribute traffic efficiently.
Scaling: Implement auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes.
CI/CD: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI for automated deployment to the cloud.
8. Cloud Storage Use Cases
Image/Video Hosting: Store media files in cloud storage such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
User Profiles and Reviews: Save user-generated content like profile pictures, reviews, and ride-related images to cloud storage.
Shared Storage: The ESCAZO Driver App will require access to the cloud storage for uploading ride-related photos or documents.
9. Monitoring and Maintenance
Set up monitoring and logging services like AWS CloudWatch or GCP Operations to track the health of the app. Additionally, implement Sentry or Datadog for error tracking.

Conclusion
This guide provides the necessary steps to set up the cloud infrastructure for both the ESCAZO App (user-facing platform) and the ESCAZO Driver App (rideshare driver app). By following this guide, you ensure a secure, scalable, and maintainable infrastructure that supports the complex needs of the ESCAZO platform.
